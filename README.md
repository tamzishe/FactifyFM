# FactifyFM
A Flask-Python App that is able to go and search for artists and musicians, it will return important facts and stats about them!

Site: https://factifyfm-1.onrender.com/

By searching for an artist, the program goes into Spotify and retrieve that data needed. 

This project involves the use of HTML and CSS, Python and the Spotify Web API (and it's documentation).
Go ahead and look through the code in the github repo.

Note that the most optimal version of this project is on a desktop/laptop, optimization for mobile can get a bit buggy

FAQ:
Q:  Where is this API hosted? 
A:  I hosted this app using Render.com. It was hard to find a good free deployment site but Render works great so far

Q:  How long did this take?
A:  I worked on this for almost 3 months, on and off, but the exact hours of work, I'm not sure.

Q:  What's next for Factify?
A:  Future plans are in the making, I hope to incorporate it into a new project someday.

Q:  What is "Popularity"?
A:  "Popularity" is Spotify's own way of measuring the impact, reach and listenership of an artist on their platform.
    I have not made this measurement, I only present that facts!
